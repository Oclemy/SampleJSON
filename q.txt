Realize deeply that the present moment is all you ever have. Make the Now the primary focus of your life.=>Eckhart Tolle->Present Moment
Wherever you are, be there totally. If you find your here and now intolerable and it makes you unhappy, you have three options: remove yourself from the situation, change it, or accept it totally.

I'm grateful for always this moment, the now, no matter what form it takes.=>Eckhart Tolle->Present Moment,Gratitude
To complain is always nonacceptance of what is. It invariably carries an unconscious negative charge. When you complain, you make yourself into a victim. When you speak out, you are in your power.

Power over others is weakness disguised as strength.=>Eckhart Tolle->Wisdom
In the stillness of your presence, you can feel your own formless and timeless reality as the unmanifested life that animates your physical form. You can then feel the same life deep within every other human and every other creature. You look beyond the veil of form and separation. This is the realization of oneness. This is love.=>Eckhart Tolle->Enlightenment,Present Moment,Love
The power for creating a better future is contained in the present moment: You create a good future by creating a good present.=>Eckhart Tolle->Present Moment
Any action is often better than no action, especially if you have been stuck in an unhappy situation for a long time. If it is a mistake, at least you learn something, in which case it's no longer a mistake. If you remain stuck, you learn nothing.=>Eckhart Tolle->Negative Emotions
Always say 'yes' to the present moment... Surrender to what is. Say 'yes' to life - and see how life starts suddenly to start working for you rather than against you.=>Eckhart Tolle->Present Moment,Life
